The need to improve ecological and environmental outcomes and reduce emmission from carbon have, in the past descade, led many African countries to increasingly adopt and incorporate REDD+ measures into national environmental policies. However, emerging evidence suggests that while adopting and incorporating such measures are expected to yield positive benefits, given the socio-complex nature of environmental management in most participating countries - managements often steeped in traditional, cultural and highly political processes - REDD+ programmes risk providing a perfect cover for certain governments and national authority figures to maintain (and reinforce) business-as-usual attitudes and approaches to tropical forests and land use management that are detrimental to the rights and safety of ceratin forest sector minorities. 

Despite the REDD+ program's attempt to respond to this challenge by instituting certain measures, such as the [the Cancun Safeguards](https://redd.unfccc.int/fact-sheets/safeguards.html) that among others, seeks to ensure governance accountability and transparency, as well as respect and protection of rights of forest sector minorities in participating countries, without stronger enforcement mechanisms in place to promote and encourage compliance by member countries, such measures risk becoming mere lip services. This is especially so in many countries in the West African sub region where forest management, even when participatory or locally oriented, tend to favor a somewhat elitist makeup. As a remnant of colonial era land and natural resource management systems in which local elites like chiefs and traditional authorities served as proxies for implementing colonial forest policies, these forest management mechanisms were, at independence, transported into the newly emerged West Minister style of government adopted by many African countries, and have never truly been replaced. Instead, in many countries, these local traditional rulership have contributed to what has been seen as a **dual state** comprising, on the one hand, a **modern** West Minister style of government within capital cities and other major metropolis, whilst in the interior and other **backward** regions, the heavy, authoritarian hands of traditional leaders - oftentimes in cahoot with central governments - reign over forest lands and natural resources, and rights and liberties of ordinary stakeholders are curtailed or trampled on. Even within less traditional communities, paticipatory forms of forest and natural resource governance in which local members are expected to actively take part in management and decision making over resource usage and allocation tend to favor elites like chiefs, land owners and wealthy members of the community, and whose interests and 

The Cancun Safeguards, among its requirements, expects participating countries to institute effective information systems for reporting on compliance. However, without an efficient system in place to ensure not just compliance by participants but, and more importantly, a thorough and efficient reporting verification that recognizes soverignties of participant countries, these safeguards risk being mere illusions for those groups they are intended to protect.
