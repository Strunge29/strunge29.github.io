The need to improve ecological and environmental outcomes and reduce emmission from carbon have, in the past decade, led many countries to increasingly adopt and incorporate REDD+ measures into national environmental policies. However, emerging evidence suggests that while adopting and incorporating such measures are expected to yield positive benefits, given the socio-complex nature of environmental management in most participating countries - managements often steeped in traditional, cultural and highly political processes - REDD+ programmes risk providing a perfect cover for certain governments and national authority figures to maintain (and reinforce) business-as-usual attitudes and approaches to tropical forests and land use management that are detrimental to the rights and safety of ordinary forest sector stakeholders. 

Despite the REDD+ program's attempt to respond to this challenge by instituting certain measures, such as the [the Cancun Safeguards](https://redd.unfccc.int/fact-sheets/safeguards.html) that among others, seeks to ensure governance accountability and transparency, as well as respect and protection of rights of forest sector minorities in participating countries, without stronger enforcement mechanisms in place to promote and encourage compliance by member countries, such measures risk becoming mere lip services. This is especially so in many countries in the West African sub region where forest management, even though participatory or locally oriented, tend to favor a somewhat elitist makeup. As remnant of colonial era land and natural resource management system in which local elites like chiefs and traditional authorities served as proxies for implementing colonial forest policies, traditional leadership amangement mechanisms have been transported into the modern postcolonial governments of many African countries, and have never truly been replaced. Instead, in many countries, these local traditional rulership have contributed to what has been seen as a **dual state** comprising, on the one hand, a **modern** West Minister style of government within capital cities and other major metropolis, whilst in the interior and other **backward** regions, the heavy, authoritarian hands of traditional leaders - oftentimes in cahoot with central governments - reign over forest lands and natural resources, and rights and liberties of ordinary stakeholders are curtailed or trampled on. Even within less traditional communities, paticipatory forms of forest and natural resource governance in which local members are expected to actively take part in management and decision making over resource usage and allocation tend to favor elites like chiefs, land owners and wealthy members of the community, and their interests and needs normally supercede those of ordinary stakeholders.

The Cancun Safeguards, among its requirements, expect participating countries to institute effective information systems for reporting on compliance. However, without an efficient system in place to ensure not just compliance by participants but, and more importantly, a thorough and efficient verification of reporting, these safeguards are in danger of being mere illusions for those groups they are intended to protect. A possible starting place would be for such reporting verification systems to recognize the politico-geographic context of countries where REDD+ programs are being implemnted. Many governments in the West African subregion, especially ones with conflict backgrounds, often have tenuous power structure and arrangements that makes enforcement of laws - including forest and natural resource laws inefficient. Governments like Ivory Coast, one of the main REDD+ participants in the subregion, is a classic case in point. After several years of unsuccessful bids to secure the presidency, the current president, [Alassane Ouattara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alassane_Ouattara), sought the aid of a rebel faction of the Ivorian army led by [Guillaume Soro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Soro), a fellow northerner, that resulted in his successful ascendancy. And for almost a decade after assuming power, extrajudicial actions by military personnel in northern Ivory Coast such as extortion in the form of illegal road tolls (seen as a form of payment or reward for helping the president assume power) have become common place, often with petty farmers, and non-timber forest product traders and harvesters, the main victims. While several such road blocks stride major roads connecting farming communities to markets in the northern part of the country, and military personnel extort from ordinary forest stakeholders with impunity, not enough is done by government to address this situation. 

Similarly, while REDD+ measures call for respecting and acknowledging local knowledge in natural resource management, on many occasions, actions by forest officials (particularly extension workers) have tended to undermine such admonition. For instance, as part of implementing REDD+ projects in countries like Ghana, measures like agroferestry, aimed at curbing land degradation and similar challeges, are heavily encouraged. However, farmers in certain cocoa producing localities have used agroforestry practices for years to manage land challenges, even before the advent of the REDD+ initiative. But their choice of crop has always been [Cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava), a popular staple food in many west African rural settings which, from constant usage, has proven useful in producing a dual benefit of helping prevent land degradation and improving food security. Yet, REDD+ technical advisors advocated (indeed, insisted on) the use of a different crop for the program's sponsored agroforestry initiative. This served to threaten the food security status of particpating communities and resulted in conflict and trust issues between implementing agencies and participating communities.

Thus, in order for challenges like the above to be effectively addressed, establishment of efficient reporting mechanisms within participating countries must be made a connerstone of REDD+ initiatives so that participating countries would be motivated to report **unfavorable** outcomes of their REDD+ implementation. Furthermore, reporting systems should make provision for effective periodic monitoring and evaluation by donor countries in order to ascertain that real outcomes of implementation are being reported. Otherwise, selective reporting by participating countries will continue to be the order of the day, and REDD+ programme initiators and donor countries would be none the wiser about the ground realities in participating settings
