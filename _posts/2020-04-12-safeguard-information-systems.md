In the past decade, the need to improve ecological and environmental outcomes and reduce carbon emissions has led many countries to increasingly adopt and incorporate REDD+ measures into national environmental and resource management policies.

However, emerging evidence suggests that while adopting and incorporating such measures are expected to yield positive benefits, given the socio-complex nature of environmental management in most participating countries - managements often steeped in traditional, cultural, and highly political processes - REDD+ programs risk providing a perfect cover for certain governments and national authority figures to maintain (and reinforce) business-as-usual attitudes and approaches to tropical forests and land use management that are detrimental to the rights and safety of ordinary forest sector stakeholders.

Despite the REDD+ program's attempt to respond to this challenge by instituting specific measures, such as the [the Cancun Safeguards](https://redd.unfccc.int/fact-sheets/safeguards.html) that, among others, seeks to ensure governance accountability and transparency, as well as respect and protection of rights of forest sector minorities in participating countries, without more robust enforcement mechanisms in place to promote and encourage accurate reporting by member countries, such measures risk becoming mere lip services. This is especially so in many countries in the West African sub-region where forest management, even though participatory and locally oriented, tends to favor a somewhat elitist makeup, and the interests and needs of elites like chiefs, landowners, and wealthy members of communities normally supersede those of ordinary stakeholders.

The Cancun Safeguards expect participating countries to institute effective information systems for reporting on compliance. However, without an efficient system in place to ensure not just compliance by participants but, and more important, a thorough and efficient verification of reporting, these safeguards are in danger of being mere illusions for those groups they are intended to protect. A possible solution would be for such proposed reporting verification systems to be cognizant of the socio-ecological and politico-geographic contexts of participating countries, and to address this head-on by  instituting effective checks and similar measures to ensure full and accurate reporting. Many governments in the West African subregion, especially ones with conflict backgrounds, often have tenuous power structures and arrangements that makes enforcement of laws - including forest and natural resource laws - inefficient. 

Governments like Ivory Coast, one of the main REDD+ participants in the subregion, are a case in point. After several years of unsuccessful bids to secure the presidency, the current regime headed by [Alassane Ouattara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alassane_Ouattara), sought the aid of a rebel faction led by [Guillaume Soro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Soro), a fellow northerner, that resulted in its ascendancy to power. And for almost a decade after assuming power, extrajudicial actions by military personnel in northern Ivory Coast, such as extortion in the form of illegal road tolls (seen as a sort of payment or reward for helping the current regime assume power), have become commonplace, often with petty farmers, and non-timber forest product traders and harvesters, as the primary victims. While several such roadblocks stride major roads connecting farming communities to markets in the northern part of the country, and military personnel extort from ordinary forest stakeholders with impunity, not enough is done by the Ouattara regime to address this situation. Within a REDD+ program implementation context such as this, full outcomes, including abuse and misuse of authorities such as described above, likely won't be reported, thereby giving donor countries and international REDD+ authorities a false sense of projects' effectiveness and usefulness.

Similarly, while the Cancun Safeguards call for respecting and acknowledging local knowledge in natural resource management, on many occasions, actions by forest officials (particularly extension workers) have tended to undermine such admonitions. For instance, as part of implementing REDD+ projects in countries like Ghana, measures like agroforestry are heavily encouraged to curb land degradation and similar challenges. However, farmers in certain cocoa-producing localities have used agroforestry practices for years to manage land challenges, even before the advent of the REDD+ initiative. Their choice of crop has often been [Cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava) and other local staples popular within many West African rural settings, which, from constant usage, have proven useful in producing a dual benefit of helping prevent land degradation and improving food security. Yet, REDD+ technical advisors advocated (indeed, insisted on) the use of a different, non-staple crop for the program's sponsored agroforestry initiative. This undermined local knowledge institutions related to agroforestry, threatened the food security status of participating communities, and resulted in conflict and trust issues between implementing agencies and participating communities.

Thus, for challenges like the above to be effectively addressed, the establishment of efficient mechanisms within implementing countries must be a cornerstone of REDD+ programs so that participating nations would be motivated to report **unfavorable** outcomes of REDD+ implementation and not just favorable ones. Furthermore, reporting systems should provide effective periodic monitoring and evaluation by donor countries to ascertain that complete, accurate implementation outcomes are being reported. Otherwise, selective reporting by participating countries will continue to be the order of the day, and REDD+ program initiators and donor countries won't be any wiser about ground realities in participating settings
