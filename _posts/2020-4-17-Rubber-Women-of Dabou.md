Felicia, short and heavy set, with badly bleached skin and uneven set of teeth stained by cigarrette and marijuana, had used the $150 she received as disarmament money in 2003 to travel nearly 1000 km from Monrovia, Liberia, to Abidjan, Ivory Coast. <!--more--> She had come in search of a fresh start after years of serving as bride to a senior official in one of the rebel battalions that fought to overthrow President Charles Taylor's government during Liberia's second civil war.

Now, 12 years after the war, and four children from two failed marriages later, she is starting to feel that the fresh start she'd thought had eluded her since arriving in Abidjan over a decade ago is possible after all. Thanks, in no small part, to the rubber loading business she'd started a few years ago.

"*It no easy for people like me to have rubber business without conneshorn (connection). Even though the money alright, I wan show that wumon (women) wif no money or conneshorn (connection) can start business in rubber and prosper*"

Africa contributes about 5 percent of global natural rubber output, with West African countries like Nigeria, Liberia and Ivory Coast considered major producers. Others like Ghana, Benin and Cameroon also have robust rubber sectors often powered by foreign multinational companies like Michelin, Firestone and others based in Europe, America and Asia.

Although set back by decades of conflicts, rubber production in countries like Liberia and Ivory Coast quickly bounced back and has now become a major breadbasket for these economies. Ivory Coast, for instance,now produces about 60 percent of Africa's rubber output. In addition to being a robust foreign exchange earner, the rubber sector also has huge livelihood opportunities. Sadly, not everyone gets a fair shot at these opportunities.

In countries like Ivory Coast, the rubber sector is populated by different actors ranging from large multinational corporations to tenant farmers, government regulators and artisanal professionals such as tappers and loaders. Multinational companies often own large processing plants as well as several hectares of rubber plantations. For instance, SIPH (Societe Internationale de Plantations d'Heveas), a French multinational corporation and a major investor of Ivorian natural rubber, own several large plantations in Ivory Coast that accounts for 34% of its total production output. The remaining 66% rubber it needs for its processing plants are bought from other plantations and small holder farms

While foreign owned companies like SIPH, OLAM, SOFCIN and many others generate a lot of local jobs, mainly administrative and technical positions, by far, the largest employment opportunities in the rubber sector comes from artisanal activities like tapping and loading. Rubber tapping is the process used to extract latex from rubber trees. It involves using hooked knife or some other similar device to make a grooved slice in the bark of a rubber tree and then peeling off the bark to allow latex to flow out and be collected into a holding cup hooked to the tree trunk near the base of the grooved slice.

It is often a backbreaking, exhausting, dangerous and injury-prone activity especially as, most of the time, the best latex reservoir inside rubber trees tend to be located high up and tappers must climb all the way to get to them. This makes it difficult for women to participate actively in these kinds of activities.

Although equally backbreaking and exhausting, rubber loading is somewhat accommodative to women. Rubber loading is part of the logistics or supply chain aspect of the rubber business and entails carting purchased natural rubber into shipping containers to be transported to shipping ports for export. It normally involves use of loading equipments like tractor loaders or excavators to scoop bales of natural rubber which are deposited inside shipping containers until they become filled. However, it is possible to substitute these heavy loading equipments with tools like shovels and pans. This is where women come in.

"*Me and my friends, we go and load rubber at SIPH and other rubber factories in Dabou (a town near the Ivorian capital, Abidjan); we use pan which we fill with rubber and carry for head to dump inside ship container until it full. It is hard work and take all day to complee (complete) but the money alright.*" Says Felicia, who after more than a decade in a Francophone country, still hadn't lost her Liberian creole accent.

Indeed calling what they do hard work is an understatement. Even using heavy machinery like tractor loaders and excavators, it can take over fifty scoops or trips to fill a single container with rubber. Normally, each shipping container (standard-sized) takes up to 24 tonnes of rubber to fill. In the absence of tractor loaders and excavators to handle the loading, about 30 to 35 persons must be on hand with pans and shovel to ensure loading can be accomplished within a single day.

As a result, it is common for several rubber loading teams to merge and handle a single loading contract. This tend to affect remuneration as loaders now have to share proceeds among several teams instead of just a single team. As such, loading mergers often prove ill-advised for people like Felicia, being a woman in a male dominated profession. In deed, on numerous occasions, she'd found herself swindled by male counterparts who refused to give her and her all-women team their fair share of proceeds that accrued from mergers they formed to execute rubber loading contracts

Weak labor laws and rampant police corruption makes seeking and obtaining redress for such swindle a forlorn hope for Felicia and her team, who often contemplate cutting out of the rubber sector and venturing into cocoa loading. Unfortunately, now isn't the best time to enter a sector like cocoa since the commodity now ranks as one of the worst performing. Rubber isn't faring any better either. Besides poor stock market performance, rubber investors (who often have Anglophone backgrounds) face language barriers and problems networking with local producers in Francophone countries like Ivory Coast. This has tended to slow down investment and development within the sector.

Also, increasing adoption of smart agriculture or green policies in many West African countries bode ill for rubber plantation development. For one, although existing rubber plantations do not in themselves condone deforestation, as rubber harvesting entails merely nipping rubber tree barks to induce latex to flow out rather than cutting an entire tree down, the establishment of plantation for rubber often require deforestation or worse land seizure. This has been known to have negative implications for livelihood in forest communities.

Recent slump in rubber prices has also shifted government priority to helping rubber producers avoid bankruptcy and recoup lost profit; little attention is being paid to concerns by artisanal professionals like Felicia who feel cheated, intimidated and bullied by their male counterparts. Rubber, unlike several other commodity crops, takes up to six to seven years to mature; afterwards, it start producing latex for 10 straight months in any given year. Thus a matured rubber tree can generate consistent monthly income for farmers or producers for several years.

Unfortunately, like many commodities, farmers or producers do not control rubber prices. Instead, this is handled by the Singapore Commodity Exchange, a major exchange for rubber trading. Due to ties to the tire manufacturing industry, rubber price tend to be linked to that of crude oil, meaning that in any given fiscal year, the performance of crude oil on the stock market has strong impact on how rubber pricing fares.

As one of the biggest producers of natural rubber, Malaysia outputs a significant portion of global rubber. And a few years ago, over 100,000 hectares of rubber trees became ripe for harvesting in Malaysia resulting in world rubber production hitting a record 13 million tonnes. Sadly, demand failed to match supply and rubber prices fell worldwide. Ivory Coast's over 160,000 rubber farmers were hit hard by the slump in prices and are, to this day, still recovering.

Thus, with the sector reeling from slump in prices, competition for rubber loading contracts has peeked to an all time high as several loading businesses have to jostle for the few contract jobs that are available. As a result, unscrupulous acts like refusal to honor merger payments and agreements has became commonplace and loaders like Felicia and her all-women team are considered easy prey. And government and others in authority have done little to help these loaders. But the women refuse to consider themselves victims. Nor would they give in to the idea of quitting. They're determined to be in the loading sector for the long haul.

"It part of the business" Felicia says, trying to downplay the hassle they face from their male colleagues. She has a sad smile revealing two missing front teeth - a legacy of her last marriage. "Sometime things down, sometime things up. We can't quit cos things down now. It's just part of business. And nobody or nothing can make we quit. I wan show dat we too can do it. I know we can. Just wait, you will see." With an outstretched index finger, she touches her right cheek before pointing up in a gesture of resolve and determination.
