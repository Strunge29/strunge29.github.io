Felicia, short and heavy set, with badly bleached skin and an uneven set of teeth stained by cigarette and marijuana, used the $150 she received as disarmament money in 2003 to travel nearly 1000 km from Monrovia, Liberia, to Abidjan, Ivory Coast. <!--more--> She came in search of a fresh start after years as a child bride of a senior official in one of the rebel battalions that fought to overthrow President Charles Taylor’s government during Liberia’s second civil war.

Now, 12 years after the war, and with four children from two failed marriages later, she feels the fresh start she’d thought was elusive is possible after all. Partly thanks to the rubber loading business she’d started a few years earlier.

"*It no easy for people like me to have rubber business without conneshorn (connection). Even though the money alrigh, I wan show that wumon (women) wif no money or conneshorn (connection) can start business in rubber and prosper*"

Africa contributes nearly 5 percent of global natural rubber output, with Western African countries like Nigeria, Liberia, and Ivory Coast considered major producers. Others like Ghana, Benin, and Cameroon have robust rubber sectors often powered by foreign multinational companies like Michelin, Firestone, and others based in Europe, America, and Asia.

In countries like Ivory Coast, the rubber sector is populated by actors ranging from large multinational corporations to tenant farmers, government regulators, and artisanal professionals such as tappers and loaders. While foreign-owned companies like SIPH, OLAM, SOFCIN, and many others generate a lot of rubber jobs, mainly administrative and technical positions, the largest employment opportunities in the sector come from artisanal activities like tapping and loading. Rubber tapping involves extracting latex from rubber trees using a hooked knife or some other similar device to make a grooved slice in the tree bark and then peeling to allow latex to flow out and be collected into a holding cup hooked to the tree trunk near the base of the grooved slice.

The activity is often backbreaking, exhausting, dangerous, and injury-prone, especially as the best latex reservoir in rubber trees tends to be located high up. Tappers must climb all the way to reach it, which makes it difficult for women to participate actively in these activities.

Although equally backbreaking and exhausting, rubber loading is somewhat accommodative to women. Rubber loading is part of the rubber business's logistics and supply chain aspect. It entails carting purchased natural rubber into shipping containers to be transported to shipping ports for export. It usually involves the use of loading equipment like tractor loaders or excavators to scoop bales of natural rubber, which are deposited inside shipping containers until they become filled. However, it is possible to substitute this heavy-loading equipment with tools like shovels and pans. This is where women come in.

"*Me and my friends, we go and load rubber at SIPH and other rubber factories in Dabou (a town near the Ivorian capital, Abidjan); we use pan which we fill with rubber and carry for head to dump inside ship container until it full. It is hard work and take all day to complee (complete) but the money alrigh.*" Says Felicia, who after more than a decade in a Francophone country, still hadn't lost her Liberian creole accent.

Indeed, calling what they do hard work is an understatement. Even using heavy machinery like tractor loaders and excavators, it can take over fifty scoops or trips to fill a single container with raw rubber. Usually, each shipping container (standard-sized) takes up to 24 tonnes of rubber to fill. Without tractor loaders and excavators to handle the loading, about 30 to 35 persons must be on hand with pans and shovels to ensure loading can be accomplished within a single day.

As a result, it is common for several rubber-loading teams to merge and handle a single loading contract. This tends to affect remuneration as loaders now have to share proceeds among several teams instead of just one. As such, mergers for rubber-loading often prove ill-advised for teams like Felicia’s, women in a male-dominated profession. The prevalence of weak labor laws and rampant police corruption makes seeking and obtaining redress for such swindles a forlorn hope for them and they often contemplate cutting out of the rubber sector and venturing into cocoa loading. Unfortunately, now isn't the best time to enter an industry like cocoa since the commodity now ranks as one of the worst-performing. Rubber isn't faring any better, either. Besides poor stock market performance, rubber investors (who often have Anglophone backgrounds) face language barriers and problems networking with local producers in Francophone countries like Ivory Coast. This has tended to slow down investment and development within the sector.

Also, the increasing adoption of smart agriculture or green policies in many West African countries bodes ill for rubber plantation development. For one, although existing rubber plantations do not in themselves condone deforestation, as rubber harvesting entails merely nipping rubber tree barks to induce latex to flow out rather than cutting an entire tree down, the establishment of a plantation for rubber often requires deforestation or worse land appropriation by the wealthy or powerful. This has been known to have negative implications for the livelihoods of ordinary locals in forest communities.

The recent slump in rubber prices has also shifted government priority to helping rubber producers avoid bankruptcy and recoup lost profit; little attention is paid to gender-based concerns about cheating and intimidations like those experienced by women-loading teams like Felicia’s. Unlike some commodities, rubber takes up to six to seven years to mature; afterward, it starts producing latex for ten straight months in any given year. Thus, a mature rubber tree can generate consistent monthly income for farmers or producers for several years.

Unfortunately, like many commodities, farmers or producers do not control rubber prices. Instead, the Singapore Commodity Exchange, a major exchange for rubber trading, does this. Due to ties to the tire manufacturing industry, rubber prices tend to be linked to crude oil, meaning that in any given fiscal year, the performance of crude oil on the stock market has a substantial impact on rubber pricing.

As one of the biggest producers of natural rubber, Malaysia produces a significant portion of global rubber. A few years ago, over 100,000 hectares of rubber trees became ripe for harvesting in Malaysia, resulting in world rubber production hitting a record 13 million tonnes. Sadly, demand failed to match supply, and rubber prices fell worldwide. Ivory Coast's over 160,000 rubber farmers, primarily males, were hit hard by the slump in prices and are, to this day, still recovering.

Thus, with the sector reeling from slumped prices, competition for rubber loading contracts peaked at an all-time high as several loading teams jostled for the few contract jobs available. As a result, unscrupulous acts like refusing to honor merger agreements among loading teams became commonplace, with teams like Felicia’s considered easy prey, being all-women. The government and others in authority have done little to help them.

"It part of the business" Felicia says, trying to downplay the hassle they face from their male colleagues. She has a sad smile revealing two missing front teeth - a legacy of her last marriage. "Sometime things down, sometime things up. We can't quit cos things down now. It's just part of business. And nobody and nothing can make we quit. I wan show dat we too can do it. I know we can. Just wait, you will see." With an outstretched index finger, she touches her right cheek before pointing up in a gesture of resolve and determination.
