I am an information scientist, a researcher, and a sustainability enthusiast. I write about livelihood trends in forest fringe communities. I use themes like 
resilience, and traditional ecological knowledge to highlight some of the strategies that fringe people living in 
forest frontier communities use to adapt to and manage challenges like poor governance and accountability,
climate change, poverty, and resource inadequacy. 

I hold a bachelors degree in political science with specialization in development administration. I have also
undertaken graduates studies in fields that focused on governance and administration of public assets, on information management to support decision making, and on
forest and natural resource conservation management. I love to read, and often use any spare time I get to learn new skills, "machine learning for ecology" being the
most recent one.
