I am an information scientist and ecological sustainability enthusiast. I write about livelihood trends in forest fringe communities using themes like 
poverty and rural resilience to highlight strategies that forest fringe populations and 
communities use to manage challenges like poor governance and accountability,
climate variability, and resource inadequacy. 

My research interest is in climate-induced ecological variability effects on biodiversity. I use applications in informatics,
biogeography, taxonomy, and data science to assess impacts of climate variability patterns on rural communities and forest ecosystems. My other interest lies in 
investigating how information is sought, acquired and used by scientists in fields such as ecology and earth sciences, 
and then applying the insights towards conceptualizing new systems and approaches for addressing these needs.

Professionally, I am interested in managing data and information within STEM-focused environments 
through the designing, implementing, and use of digital, spatial, and open-source information systems and best practices. 
I hold a bachelors degree in political science with a minor in geography. I have also
undertaken graduate studies in the governance and administration of public assets 
as well as in information systems management to support natural resource conservation. 
I love to read and use my spare time to improve my programming and cartographic skills.
